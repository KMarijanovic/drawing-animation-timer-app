Timer app (2021)

This is "the completed code" for the Timer app exercise made by coding along with Stephen Grinder in "The Modern JS Bootcamp Course (2021) | Udemy" by Colt Steele & Stephen Grider.

In the files You will find added comments that are pointing to those extra added code onto the main one for final touches and solving chalenges like:

(style:)
- setting stroke to light green when start
- setting stroke to light gray when completed
- setting stroke to light blue while setting or changing the input
- added transparent background to the original buttons
- centering the timer

(solutions:)
- pausing the timer and continuing the animation from that same point
- setting stroke-dashoffset to 0 after completion of the timer
- added eventListener and a method for clearing the input while timer is running
- prevent speeding the timer on the second click to the play button

For extra changes in styling there could be more done and it's open to change.

This exercise is more focused on JS rather than CSS.
